            <h3>Geiranger Fjord</h3>
            <p>An amazingly beautiful fjord in the Sunnmere region, located in the southernmost part of the Mere og Romsdal fjord in Norway.
                 It is located approximately 200 kilometers northeast of Bergen. 
                 There are a huge number of waterfalls, and everything in the district is covered with greenery. 
                 You can go up to the Geiranger lookout for a great view of the harbor. 
                 Geiranger is included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 
                 Along the shores there are vertical rocks with a height of 1400 meters. 
                 Along the Geiranger Fjord there are also abandoned farms,
                  some of them are located on small platforms of mountain ledges,
                 so you can reach them only with the help of special ladders or rope ladders.</p>
